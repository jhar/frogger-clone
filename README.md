Frogger Clone
=============

A simple HTML5 canvas based game that mimics that gameplay of the classic arcade game Frogger

To play the game:

* Download all files
* Load index.html in a browser
* Move the player with the up, down, left and right arrow keys
* Colliding with an enemy resets the player position and logs a "loss" message
* Getting to the water resets the player position and logs a "win" message
* Otherwise the game has no ending and can be played indefinitely
