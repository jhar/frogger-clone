Frogularity
===========

The world is changing, and so is Frogger. Long gone are the 80s, arcade boxes, National Lampoon's
Vaction movies, and frogs dodging station wagons to cross the road. The modern world has
smartphones, Teslas, T-1000s, cybernetic "soft" machine humanoids who can pass a Turing test,
a super powerful AI that exerts absolute authority over all world affairs, and of course the
singularity and technology so powerful and incomprehensible to tiny human brains that we cower
in fear and speak of magic and gods when the space-faring plasma dragons cruise by earth.

But, in this game, you're just a damn frog trying to cross the damn road...
